My name is Anna, and I'm an engineer and a scientist. I study Materials Science and Engineering at the University of
Michigan; and I graduated from Virginia Tech with a degree in Physics. My thesis project deals with computationally
predicting the properties of materials used in lithium-ion batteries and airplane turbine blades.

I'm writing this blog post for SciRuby, but I'm really writing it for the young women out there. SciRuby is applying to
participate in [Google's Code-In 2013](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gci/), which aims to get high school
students involved in the open source movement, and specifically in coding. It's great preparation for college and
beyond — whatever you might choose to study.

I became involved in science because I love figuring stuff out and working with smart, interesting people, and I want
you to get involved, too. Modern science wouldn't be possible without open source software. Moreover, if you learn how
to code, you'll always have a job. Always.

And the cool part is that you don't have to know how to code in order to participate. Many of the tasks involve research
and documentation in science and mathematics — which is a great way to obtain valuable experience for college
applications.
