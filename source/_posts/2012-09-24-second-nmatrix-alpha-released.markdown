On Friday, we released the somewhat overdue second alpha of [NMatrix](http://github.com/SciRuby/nmatrix), version 0.0.2.

This second alpha has boasts a significantly improved and much more maintainable code base, thanks to our Summer 2012
 SciRuby Fellow, [Chris Wailes](https://github.com/chriswailes), and sponsoring organization [Brighter Planet](http://brighterplanet.com). <!--more-->

The library has been almost completely rewritten in C++, with API available for both C and C++.

It also includes basic slicing support for dense and list matrices and dense LU decomposition.

Check it out and let us know what you think! Remember to look in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/SciRuby/nmatrix/issues?direction=desc&sort=created&state=open)
 if you have any problems.

Finally, if you're a student, you should consider applying to be a [SciRuby Fellow](/blog/2012/09/24/sciruby-receives-ruby-association-grant--fellowships-available/) this winter or spring.
