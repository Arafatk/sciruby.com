We were blown away by the quality of the application pool for our first ever SciRuby Summer of Code, sponsored by [Brighter Planet](http://brighterplanet.com). We received eight exemplary applications for a single placement, and nearly every applicant showed up on at least
 one selection committee member's top-three list.

I am pleased to report that we have selected [Chris Wailes](https://github.com/chriswailes), a doctoral student in Computer
 Science at the University of Colorado at Boulder, to be the recipient of our fellowship this year.

Chris plans to contribute to NMatrix, by adding parallel computing support and/or by creating a Ruby domain-specific language for
 linear algebra.

The SciRuby Project is deeply grateful to Brighter Planet for its generous support of our
 relatively new project and this fellowship program. We also wish to thank the applicants, and encourage them to apply
 again next time.
