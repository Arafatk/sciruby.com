I thought I'd start by introducing myself. I'm the project director for SciRuby, and I'm a molecular biology doctoral
 student at the University of Texas. I work in the [Marcotte Lab](http://marcottelab.org/), and actually occupy the
 former desk (and lab hostname) of John Prince, another of the SciRuby project leads.

In addition to working as a graduate student, I am a blogger and an offline political activist -- specifically, a
 community organizer. While I have contributed code to SciRuby already, and plan to continue, my main role here derives
 from my community organizing experience: **I want *you* to get involved.**

In that vein, I have written [a fascinating (and humble) precautionary tale](/blog/2011/08/15/the-challenges-of-copyrights/).

Oh, and if do you want to get involved, you can find us in #sciruby (Freenode.net), or you can come check out our
[Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/sciruby-dev).
