We are incredibly pleased to announce that the Ruby Association has awarded us a [1,000,000 JPY grant](http://www.ruby.or.jp/en/news/20120717.html).

When we applied, we proposed to build upon our [successful SciRuby Summer of Code](http://sciruby.com/blog/2012/05/08/sciruby-summer-of-code/),
which we undertook with the support of [Brighter Planet](http://brighterplanet.com). We are pleased to announce applications
for SciRuby fellowships.<!--more-->

## Funding Note

A million yen translates to around $12,000, which is nearly enough to hire two graduate or undergraduate students
for an academic term. We would like to hire more than one; but for that, [we need your help](http://pledgie.com/campaigns/15783).

## Fellowship Terms

* We plan to provide each fellow with a monthly stipend competitive with her or his home institution (e.g., if research assistants
 in your graduate program typically receive $1,500 per month, your stipend with us would be $1,500 per month).
* Tenure will be one semester or one quarter (with an option to renew for a second quarter), depending upon the academic
 calendar of the student's home institution.
* Tenure must begin no later than January 2013.
* Fellows are expected to work full-time (forty hours per week) on some element of [NMatrix](http://github.com/SciRuby/nmatrix).
* The Ruby Association requires monthly progress reports for stipend payment.
* Fellows will be assigned mentors, but should expect to work relatively independently unless located near a SciRuby mentor.

## Requirements

* Fluency in C/C++, Ruby, and the English language.
* Comfort with git and Github.
* An understanding of GDB and Valgrind (or similar debugging tools) as well as RSpec.
* A course of study in the sciences or engineering at an accredited college or university.
