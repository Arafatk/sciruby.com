Hello, I am Naoki, one of four GSoC 2014 students in SciRuby. Let me introduce my project. The goal of GSoC 2014 D3 Project is to create a new plotting library for SciRuby. D3.js is the most suitable JavaScript library to achieve this goal.

There are several plotting software like ggplot, matplotlib, and ggplot2, and actually SciRuby already has its plotting library named '[Plotrb](https://github.com/SciRuby/plotrb).' And the main feature of this project compared with those software is 'interactivity.' This word contains various meanings, as interactivity when generating plots, looking at them, and Server<->Client interactivity. Our project contains all of those.

Our project can be divided into 2 parts, JavaScript part as back-end and Ruby part as front-end. I'm now doing the former part. Have a look examples below:

* [Scatter](http://bl.ocks.org/domitry/308e27d8d12c1374e61f)
* [Another theme](http://bl.ocks.org/domitry/f215d5ff3bd3f5fec2ad)

This project contains some hard parts, but I believe I can achieve it during this summer. Thank you.
