We just had an interview published today over at [Floss for Science](http://www.floss4science.com/interview-sciruby-team/),
 and we're super excited because it's our very first media coverage.

If you want to vote it up at [reddit](http://www.reddit.com), that would be outstanding &emdash; or share it however you
 like to share things. Here are the links:

* [r/ruby](http://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/jlkur/interview_sciruby_team/)

Already we've had a bunch of new people joining us on IRC (#sciruby on Freenode) and in our
 [Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/sciruby-dev). Thanks for all your support!
