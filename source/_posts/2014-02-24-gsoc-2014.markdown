We're excited to announce that the Ruby Science Foundation has been selected as
a mentoring organization for [Google Summer of Code
2014](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2014)!  Last year
was our first year as a mentoring organization, and we had a great group of
students working with us on machine learning, timeseries statistics, the
semantic web, and scientific plotting.  This year we've got a super set of
possible projects including more flexible matrix computations, automatic ruby
interface generation for scientific libraries, a dataframe library for
structuring and manipulating datasets, interactive plotting, a scientific
notebook, high-performance minimization and integration libraries, and a
semantic web datastore backend for scientific computing.

If you're interested in applying as a student, learning more, or even
contributing independent of GSoC, head over to our [GSoC 2014 ideas
page](https://github.com/SciRuby/sciruby/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code-2014-Ideas)
to see what projects we think are great.  Don't hesitate to tell us if you've
got an amazing idea for a different project, too! If you're still left
wondering where to start, check out the [issue tracker for
NMatrix](https://github.com/sciruby/nmatrix/issues), the matrix computation
library used as the basis for a number of our projects, and our top priority at
the moment.

Good luck to all the GSoC applicants out there, and happy coding!
