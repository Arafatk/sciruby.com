We are pleased to announce the second <em>alpha</em> release (0.0.2) of NMatrix, a component of SciRuby.

NMatrix is an experimental linear algebra library for Ruby, written mostly in C++. It can be used with or without SciRuby,
but is part of the SciRuby project.

NMatrix was inspired by, and originally based heavily upon, [NArray](http://narray.rubyforge.org) by Masahiro Tanaka.

For a list of features, installation instructions, etc., please see [the README](https://github.com/SciRuby/nmatrix/blob/master/README.rdoc).
