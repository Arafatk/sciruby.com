NMatrix is a fast numerical linear algebra library for Ruby, written mostly in C and C++. It is part of the SciRuby project.

* [Current NMatrix gem release RDoc](/nmatrix/docs/)
* [NMatrix wiki: Installation](https://github.com/SciRuby/nmatrix/wiki/Installation)
* [NMatrix wiki: Getting Started](https://github.com/SciRuby/nmatrix/wiki/Getting-started)

We are in the process of switching from RDoc to YARD. YARD does not yet support parsing C++ sources, but we're working
with the YARD developers to get it enabled. [Here are the YARD docs generated from the most recent commit in Github.](http://rdoc.info/github/SciRuby/nmatrix/)
You can, of course, also generate these in RDoc format if you've cloned our git repository; the command is <code>rake rdoc</code>.
