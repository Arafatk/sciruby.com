<h2>The SciRuby Manifesto</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> has for some time had no equivalent to the beautifully constructed <a href="http://numpy.scipy.org/">NumPy</a>, <a href="http://www.scipy.org/">SciPy</a>, and <a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/">matplotlib</a> libraries for <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>.</p>

<p>We believe that the time for a Ruby science and visualization package has come and gone. Sometimes when a solution of sugar and water becomes super-saturated, from it precipitates a pure, delicious, and diabetes-inducing crystal of sweetness, induced by no more than the tap of a finger. So it is, we believe, with the need for numeric and visualization libraries in Ruby.</p>

<p>We are not the first with this idea, but we are trying to bring it to life.</p>

<h2>Project Status</h2>
<p>Our first pre-alpha (0.1.3) is available. If you want to play around with the code, you can clone the <a href="http://github.com/SciRuby/sciruby">repository</a>. Otherwise, you can <a href="/docs#installation">install using RubyGems</a>.</p>

<p>The first pre-alpha includes a GUI for Rubyvis, Plotter, written by John Woods; as well as a statistical analysis domain-specific language tool, Analysis, by Claudio Bustos. It can also load many, but not all, R datasets, as long as you have R installed.</p>

<p>We released this pre-alpha because of a sudden influx of interest (we were in the top position on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3180369">Hacker News</a> for several hours!).</p>

<p>The first <em>actual</em> alpha release should include Numarray, our NArray rewrite, for which a spec is now being written by John Prince; we also hope to have better matrix support (namely sparse storage).</p>

<h3 id="roadmap">Roadmap</h3>
<p>Our general roadmap for future development can be found <a href="https://github.com/SciRuby/sciruby/wiki/Roadmap">here</a>. Specific items that need to be accomplished in the short term are listed in our <a href="https://github.com/sciruby/sciruby/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=open">issue tracker</a>.</p>

<h2 id="installation">Getting SciRuby</h3>

<p class="warning"><strong>Word to the wise:</strong> These gems have been tested, but not extensively. If you're thinking of using SciRuby to write mission critical code, such as for driving a car or flying a space shuttle, you may wish to choose other software (for now).</p>

<p><a href="/docs#installation">Instructions for installing SciRuby</a> are available in our <a href="/docs">docs</a>.</p>

<h2 id="developers">Developers</h2>

<p>You can find the <a href="https://github.com/SciRuby/sciruby/wiki/Roster">full roster</a> on our <a href="https://github.com/SciRuby/sciruby/wiki/">project wiki</a>.</p>
