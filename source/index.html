<p>Ruby has for some time had no equivalent to the beautifully constructed numpy, scipy, and matplotlib libraries for Python. We believe that the time for a Ruby science and visualization package has come and gone. Sometimes when a solution of sugar and water becomes super-saturated, from it precipitates a pure, delicious, and diabetes-inducing crystal of sweetness, induced by no more than the tap of a finger. So it is, we believe, with the need for numeric and visualization libraries in Ruby.</p>

<p>We are not the first with this idea, but we are trying to bring it to life.</p>

<p>At this point, SciRuby is not a single gem (there is a sciruby gem, but it's really just a placeholder). If you want to use the numerical, statistical, scientific, and visualization tools that have been written thus far, we recommend you try out the following component gems:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Visualization:</em> rubyvis</li>
<li><em>Statistics:</em> statsample</li>
<li><em>Numerics:</em> <a href="https://github.com/princelab/narray">narray</a>, minimization</li>
<li><em>Probability:</em> distribution</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that we are in the process of rewriting NArray, and that none of these are finished products. If you like what you see, or would like to get involved, please join our <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/sciruby-dev">Google Group</a> or find us in #sciruby on IRC (Freenode.net).</p>
