<h2>The SciRuby Manifesto</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> has for some time had no equivalent to the beautifully constructed <a href="http://numpy.scipy.org/">NumPy</a>, <a href="http://www.scipy.org/">SciPy</a>, and <a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/">matplotlib</a> libraries for <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>.</p>

<p>We believe that the time for a Ruby science and visualization package has come and gone. Sometimes when a solution of sugar and water becomes super-saturated, from it precipitates a pure, delicious, and diabetes-inducing crystal of sweetness, induced by no more than the tap of a finger. So it is, we believe, with the need for numeric and visualization libraries in Ruby.</p>

<p>We are not the first with this idea, but we are trying to bring it to life.</p>

<h2>Project Status</h2>
<p>At this point, SciRuby is not a single gem (there is a <span class="gem">sciruby</span> gem, but it's really just a placeholder). If you want to use the numerical, statistical, scientific, and visualization tools that have been written thus far, we recommend you try out the following component gems:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Visualization:</em> <span class="gem"><a href="https://github.com/clbustos/rubyvis">rubyvis</a></span></li>
<li><em>Statistics:</em> <span class="gem"><a href="https://github.com/clbustos/statsample">statsample</a></span></li>
<li><em>Numeric:</em> <span class="gem"><a href="https://github.com/princelab/narray">narray</a></span>, <span class="gem"><a href="https://github.com/clbustos/minimization">minimization</a></span>, <span class="gem"><a href="https://github.com/clbustos/integration">integration</a></span></li>
<li><em>Probability:</em> <span class="gem"><a href="https://github.com/clbustos/distribution">distribution</a></span></li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that we are in the process of rewriting NArray, and that none of these are finished products. If you like what you see, or would like to get involved, please join our Google Group (see below) or find us in #sciruby on IRC (Freenode.net).</p>

<h2 id="installation">Getting SciRuby</h3>

<p class="warning"><strong>Word to the wise:</strong> These gems have been tested, but not extensively. If you're thinking of using SciRuby to write mission critical code, such as for driving a car or flying a space shuttle, you may wish to choose other software (for now).</p>

<pre><code>gem install rubyvis statsample minimization distribution integration
</code></pre>

<p>Note that <span class="gem">distribution</span> and <span class="gem">integration</span> can optionally make use of <span class="gem"><a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/rb-gsl/">gsl</a></span> and <span class="gem"><a href="https://github.com/abscondment/statistics2">statistics2</a></span>, which implement C versions of several of the methods. They may speed things up a bit, and have been tested much more thoroughly. These can be installed like so:</p>

<pre><code>gem install gsl statistics2
</code></pre>
