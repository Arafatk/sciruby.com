<h2>The SciRuby Manifesto</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> has for some time lacked libraries implementing the basic tools needed for scientific computing and data visualization.</p>

<p>We believe that the time for a Ruby science and visualization package has come. Sometimes when a solution of sugar and water becomes super-saturated, from it precipitates a pure, delicious, and diabetes-causing crystal of sweetness, induced by no more than the tap of a finger. So it is, we believe, with the need for numeric and visualization libraries in Ruby.</p>

<p>We are not the first with this idea, but we are bringing it to life.</p>

<h2>Project Status</h2>
<p>A few months ago, we shipped our first beta release of <a href="nmatrix/">NMatrix</a>, the SciRuby linear algebra library. NMatrix includes both dense and sparse matrix storage, and we are working on including full ATLAS and LAPACK support.</p>

<p>Our key goals in the short term are improved visualization software and continued development of our linear algebra software (NMatrix and MDArray). We have several experimental plotting libraries &mdash; such as Rubyvis, Plotrb, and Nyaplot &mdash; and are interested in improving existing APIs, such as for Gnuplot.</p>

<h3 id="irc">SciRuby on IRC</h3>

<p>Our IRC channel is most active during the months of Google Summer of Code, but generally there are always a few people around. You can find us on Freenode.net in <tt>#sciruby</tt>.</p>

<h2 id="installation">Getting SciRuby</h3>

<p class="warning"><strong>Word to the wise:</strong> These gems have been tested, but are not battle-hardened. If you're thinking of using NMatrix (or other SciRuby components) to write mission critical code, such as for a self-driving car or controlling an ARKYD 100 satellite, you should expect to encounter a few bugs --- and be prepared for them.</p>

<p><a href="/docs">Instructions for installing various SciRuby components are available in our docs.</a></p>

<p><a href="/nmatrix/">You can find our NMatrix documentation here.</a></p>

<h2 id="developers">Developers</h2>

<p>You can find the <a href="https://github.com/SciRuby/sciruby/wiki/Roster">full roster</a> on our <a href="https://github.com/SciRuby/sciruby/wiki/">project wiki</a>.</p>

<h3 id="get-involved">Want to get involved?</h3>

<p><strong>Say you have a few hours and are itching to get your hands dirty.</strong> The best place to look right now is <a href="https://github.com/sciruby/nmatrix/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=open">the NMatrix issue tracker</a> on Github. Pick something that interests you and fork us!</p>

<p>You might also check out the <a href="https://github.com/sciruby/sciruby/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=open">SciRuby issue tracker</a> if matrices don't interest you much.</p>
