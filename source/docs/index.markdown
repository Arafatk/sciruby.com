<h3>Other Gems</h3>

If you have any trouble getting SciRuby to work and are too impatient to seek assistance, most of the SciRuby components are already available as individual packages. We recommend you try out the following component gems:

<ul>
<li><em>Visualization:</em> <span class="gem"><a href="https://github.com/clbustos/rubyvis">rubyvis</a></span>, <span class="gem"><a href="https://github.com/zuhao/plotrb">plotrb</a></span></li>
<li><em>Statistics and Probability:</em> <span class="gem"><a href="https://github.com/clbustos/statsample">statsample</a></span>, <span class="gem"><a href="https://github.com/clbustos/distribution">distribution</a></span></li>
<li><em>Numeric:</em> <span class="gem"><a href="https://github.com/clbustos/minimization">minimization</a></span>, <span class="gem"><a href="https://github.com/clbustos/integration">integration</a></span>, <span class="gem"><a href="https://github.com/SciRuby/nmatrix">nmatrix</a></span></li>
</ul>

<h4>SciRuby</h4>

The SciRuby gem is currently on hold. Frankly, we don't know what to put in it. In the end it'll probably end up just
kind of directing the installation of other gems. In other words, you'll install the SciRuby gem, and that'll cause the
other gems to be installed automatically. But for now, you have to install them all by hand, as we simply don't have
enough volunteers to keep everything up-to-date dependency-wise.

Project Status
--------------
As we are currently alpha, documentation is a work in progress. If you want to get involved, please drop by our [Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/sciruby-dev) or our IRC channel, <tt>#sciruby</tt>.

Documentation for existing gems is scattered. You can look through the links below for additional information.
